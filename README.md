# overleaf-git-sync

A script that takes an Overleaf project and pushes it to a git remote.
It is useable without any premium membership bs.

## How to use
**Warning: Please be sure the TOS of the Overleaf instance you want to use allows this kind of script! I'm not responsible if you get banned and/or lose your work!**

**I have done no testing for instances with CAPTCHA enabled. If it is, the script will most certainly not work.**

- Install requirements
- Open `sync.py` and insert all the necessary settings
- Run `sync.py`

When the settings are filled, it should work without user interaction, so you can run it as a cron job.
